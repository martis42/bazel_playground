# Bazel Playground

These are toy examples, notes and experiments for using the [Bazel Build System](https://bazel.build/).

## Disclaimer
The toy examples do not represent novel information about using Bazel.
The described behavior can be researched by reading the upstream documentation.
The focus of those toy examples is to provide concrete code to fiddle around with as well to make it easier to understand the described behavior (e.g. for transitive dependencies or combining multiple features).

## Environment
The examples have been created and tested with:
* 64 bit Ubuntu 20.04
* `gcc` 9.3
* `bazel` >= 4.0
